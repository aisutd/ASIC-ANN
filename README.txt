This is our basic architecture so far for our application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for a forward feeding neural network architecture.


Major things to get done:
Reverse feeding neural network
Backpropogation

Minor things to get done:
Mathematical circuits (learned multiplication, addition, and subtraction)
Bit comparison ciruit (learned in class today)

Suggestion by WChurchill: Use sequential datapath instead of layers in neural network.
